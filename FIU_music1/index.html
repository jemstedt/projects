				It is important that you only participate in this experiment if you are using a laptop or a stationary computer that has a keyboard. If you are using a device with a touch screen you will not be able to complete the experiment.<br>
				If you end the experiment before completing it (by closing the browser window) none of your data will be saved except for your consent form. <br>
				You are not allowed to use any external help to learn any of the words (e.g., writing them on a notepad).<br>
				Please turn off your phone and close all programs and other browser windows before continuing with the experiment.<br>
				
			</p>
			<h4 class=infoH1>Below is the general outline of the experiment.</h4>
			<p>
				- Rate 20 words on how likely it is that you will learn each one for the memory test.<br>
				- Study the words for 5 seconds each.<br>
				- Judge the correctness of mathematical equations for 30 seconds.<br>
				- Memory test. You Have 3 minutes to type as many of the studied words on the keyboard as you can remember.<br>
				- A short questionnaire about the experiment.<br>
			</p>
			<p>You will receive more specific instructions before the start of each part of the experiment.</p>

			<h1 class='infoH1'>Memory test</h1>
			<p class='infoP'>
				You will now have 180 seconds (3 minutes) to recall as many of the words as possible. You cannot end the test before the 180 seconds has ended. 
			</p>
			<p class='infoP'>
				- You respond by typing the words on the keyboard and then pressing the ENTER key after each word. <br>
				- You DO NOT have to recall if the words were presented with upper-case letters or if they alternated between upper- and lower-case letters. <br>
				- That is, all your responses can be given in lower-case letters, and will still be scored as correct. <br>
				- It is important that you spell the words correct.

			Please read carefully.<br>
			You will now be presented with 20 words one at a time. For each word, your task is to rate how likely it is that you will learn it for the memory test at the end of the experiment. After rating all of the words, you will study them one at a time for 5 seconds each. Then after studying the words you will judge the correctness of mathematical equations for 30 seconds, and then complete a memory test.  <br>
			</p>
			<p class='infoP'>
			- You have 5 seconds to rate each word, it is important that you try to rate all of the words.
			- The experiment proceeds to the next word once you've rated it or the 5 seconds have passed.
			- Out of the 20 words, 10 will be presented in only upper-case letters (e.g., LETTER) and 10 will be presented with alternating upper- and lower-case letters (e.g., lEtTeR).<br>
			- In this rating part of the experiment, focus on rating the words and try to avoid actively studying them.<br>
			- When you later study each word, they will be presented in the same way as when you rated them. That is, with either only upper-case letters or alternating upper- and lower-case letters.<br>
			- On the memory test, you DO NOT have to recall how the words were presented, or in what order they were presented. That is, all your responses can be given in lower-case letters, and will still be scored as correct.
			</p>
			<p class='infoP'>
			- You will rate the words on a scale from 0% to 100% in intervals of 20%. <br>
			- You rate the words by clicking on the button corresponding to each percentage on the screen (e.g., 20%).<br>
			- When you use the scale, try to rate the words so that out of all the words rated with a percentage, you will recall that many of the words on the memory test. <br>
			- For example: Out of all the words you rated as 20%, you will recall 20% of these on the memory test.<br>

			2.	You will study each word one at a time.<br>
			3.	You will judge the correctness of mathematical equations (e.g., 2 x 2 = 5).<br>
			4.	You will complete a memory test in which you should type all the words you can remember from the experiment.</p>
